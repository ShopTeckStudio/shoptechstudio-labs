# 🌐 NGINX Stack

This folder contains a Docker-based NGINX stack used as a reverse proxy and static file server within a homelab environment.

The stack is designed to be modular, lightweight, and easy to rebuild, while providing a clean foundation for routing traffic to internal services.

---

## 🔍 What This Stack Does

* Reverse proxy for internal services
* Static file hosting (HTML and assets)
* Central entry point for homelab applications
* Persistent logging for debugging and monitoring
* Scalable foundation for SSL and multi-service routing

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
docker/
├── monitoring/
├── nginx/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── config/
│   ├── html/
│   └── logs/
├── pihole/
```

This repository structure is for documentation and organization.
Your Docker host should only contain files referenced by `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## 💻 Expected Local Host Structure

```
docker/nginx/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── config/
│   └── default.conf
├── html/
│   └── index.html
└── logs/
```

* `config/` contains NGINX configuration files
* `html/` contains static web files
* `logs/` stores persistent access and error logs

---

## 🛠️ Initial Setup

Run the following on your Docker host:

```
cd docker
mkdir nginx
cd nginx

mkdir config html logs

touch docker-compose.yml
touch config/default.conf
touch html/index.html
```

---

## ⚙️ Docker Compose Configuration

Edit the compose file:

```
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste in the complete `docker-compose.yml`, then save and exit:

Save and exit:

* CTRL + O → Enter
* CTRL + X

---

## ⚙️ NGINX Configuration

Edit config/default file:

```
nano config/default.conf
```

Paste in the complete `default.conf`, then save and exit:

---

## 📄 Test Page

Edit html/index file:

```
nano html/index.html
```

Paste in the complete `index.html`, then save and exit:

---

## ▶️ Start the Stack

```
docker compose up -d
```

Check status:

```
docker compose ps
```

---

## 🌐 Access

Open in browser:


```
http://<server-ip>
```

You will need to update <server-ip> with the ip of the computer you installed the container.

---

## 🔁 Updating Configuration

After making changes:

```
docker compose restart nginx
```

---

## 📊 Logs

Logs are stored locally:

```
nginx/logs/
```

---

## ➕ Future Enhancements

* SSL with Let's Encrypt
* Reverse proxy to internal services
* Domain-based routing
* Integration with monitoring stack
* NGINX metrics and dashboards

---

## 🧱 Design Approach

* Minimal configuration
* Clear file structure
* Persistent data handling
* Easy to expand into a full reverse proxy system

---

## 🧰 Part of Homelab Stack

This stack integrates with:

* Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
* DNS (Pi-hole)
* Smart Home (Home Assistant)
* Remote access (Tailscale)

---
