# Docker Stacks

This folder contains Docker Compose stacks used in my homelab and server environment.

The goal of these stacks is to keep services modular, reproducible, and easy to deploy or rebuild on new hardware. Each subfolder represents a self-contained stack focused on a specific function (monitoring, networking, media, automation, etc.).

Some stacks are actively used, others are experimental, and some may evolve over time as the lab grows.

> ⚠️ Note: Configuration files shared here are examples and templates only.  
> Secrets, credentials, and environment-specific values are intentionally excluded.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or use anything here as a starting point for your own setup.
